This work is an HLS implemention of a Physical Layer Deep Learning communications system.
The system implements [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8054694](O'Shea et. al paper).
The TensorFlow model used to train this is based on [https://github.com/immortal3/AutoEncoder-Based-Communication-System](immortal3's implementation)
The project is based on the [https://hls-fpga-machine-learning.github.io/hls4ml/](hls4ml) package
